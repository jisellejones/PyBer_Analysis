# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
We analyzed the first quarter 2019 ride share data to determine the weekly fares in different types of cities (rural, suburban, and urban). The purpose of this analysis is to help PyBer improve business decisions.

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
